Hi there! My name is Mikaela, or Kelly, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for video games. I have been playing games since the original Nintendo, along with having LAN parties with my family playing games like Hexen and Doom.

Some of my favorite games include The Last of Us Part I & II, Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, the Zelda series, and the Halo series.
