In "Guiding Light," I demonstrated C++ game programming skills by redesigning levels, creating a pixelated shader, developing a flickering lantern effect, and integrating Google Text-to-Speech for dialogue and button audio. This project showcased my focus on both innovative game design and accessibility for visually impaired users. This project was part of my entry for the [Rookie Awards 2024](https://www.therookies.co/entries/30189), a prestigious competition spotlighting emerging talent in the creative industry.
