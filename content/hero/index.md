I'm a frontend software engineer proficient in languages like JavaScript and TypeScript, specializing in creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. My current focus is on transitioning my expertise toward becoming a skilled game programmer and technical artist with skills in technologies like C++, Unreal Engine, Maya, and Substance Painter. I'm excited about developing my abilities in these areas to contribute to the creation of engaging and immersive gameplay experiences.
