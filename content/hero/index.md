As a frontend software engineer with a strong foundation in JavaScript and TypeScript, I've honed my ability to craft user-friendly and visually engaging interfaces. Now, I am passionately pivoting towards a career as a Character Rigger / Technical Artist. Driven by a passion for bringing characters to life in the digital world, I am developing my skills in scripting to streamline animation workflows and tackle technical challenges. With a growing expertise in Python, C++, Unreal Engine, and Maya, I'm eager to leverage my keen eye for detail and commitment to technical excellence. Eager to grow and contribute to dynamic teams, I am on a path to blend my software engineering background with my aspiration to master the art and science behind captivating character animations in immersive game environments.
