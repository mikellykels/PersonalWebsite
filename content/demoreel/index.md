I'm a software engineer who has come full circle - from studying art and design to building web applications at scale, and now creating gameplay experiences and technical solutions for games. I leverage my technical background with Python, C++, and tools like Maya, MotionBuilder, and Unreal Engine to prototype gameplay mechanics and build technical systems that bring creative visions to life. Currently working as an Associate Game Designer (Technical) at Naughty Dog!
