I'm a software engineer who has come full circle - from studying art and design to building web applications at scale, and now creating character rigs and technical animation solutions for games. I leverage my technical background with Python, C++, and tools like Maya, MotionBuilder, and Unreal Engine to build dynamic character systems. Currently expanding my expertise through CG Spectrum's mentorship program while working on hands-on projects - check out what I'm building!
