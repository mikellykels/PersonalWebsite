I'm a software engineer combining my technical background with my passion for game development. With experience building web applications at scale, I'm now making character rigs and technical art solutions using tools like Python, C++, Maya, MotionBuilder, and Unreal Engine. My journey has come full circle - from studying art and design to engineering, and now back to creating dynamic character systems and technical art for games. Currently studying at CG Spectrum while expanding my expertise through one-on-one mentorship and hands-on development - check out what I'm building!
